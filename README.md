# Fraud-Detection
Project Name: Fraud detection in Procurement in E-Groceries.


# Project Research


#### What is Procurement?


It is a process of purchasing goods and services for an individual, society, organization 
or group in systematic and planned way which includes exchange of information, plan 
and purpose.

#### What is procurement fraud?

o Procurement fraud can be defined as dishonestly obtaining an advantage, 
avoiding an obligation or causing a loss to public property or various means 
during procurement process by public servants, contractors or any other person 
involved in the procurement.

o In simple words, it is a kickback to the buyer from the supplier for selecting the 
supplier’s bid and which might not be in the Company’s best interest.

o Procurement fraud occurs when there is deliberate deception within the 
procedure-to-pay process that results in some type of financial gain, or loss.


#### What are Common Procurement Fraud Schemes?

In practice, procurement fraud can be carried out in a number of ways, usually with the 
employee and vendor working together. Procurement employees award a vendor a contract 
and get something for themselves in return. An employee might do this because they:

• Have a personal connection to the vendor: The vendor is the employee’s family 
member or friend. By awarding the vendor the contract, the employee enjoys 
fulfilment in their relationship and/or shares in the financial rewards of the contract.

• Are a silent partner of the vendor: The employee is secretly part owner of the vendor’s 
business and will experience financial gain when the vendor wins the contract.

• Receive bribes and kickbacks: The vendor offers the employee gifts or a share of their 
earnings in exchange for a contract. These could include anything from money to 
membership at a country club to luxury goods.


#### FRAUDS IN E-COMMERCE FIELD

o The level of E-commerce fraud is high. Customersrely heavily on decisionsto purchase
products either on commerce sites or in online retail outlets

o In today's digital world the idea of spams and frauds have become a threat to both
customers and companies. Identifying the fake reviews is a complex and difficult task.

o According to the proposed research, certain systems were considered that supports
different attributes and domains like few are used for detection of fraudulent
credit card, this is also important because in case of fraudulent credit card heavy
financial loss can be caused. And few only detects the fake and fraudulent reviews, but
this proposed methodology not only intends to detect fraudulent reviews but also to
remove them from the database.

o This proposed e-commerce web application gets reviews as the inputs from the users,
stores them in the database and then proposed methods are used to detect the
spammers.


#### FRAUDS IN E-GROCERIES FIELD

Online groceries were often thought of as one of the most predictable ecommerce segments; 
loyal customers with recognisable buying patterns, typically at their home address, making it 
easier to spot suspicious activity. 

Now, with more people feeling comfortable buying online, wanting to shop around for the best 
prices and quickest delivery slots, and open to trying out new digital services, there are more 
accounts being opened and behaviour is less predictable — which is where the fraud problem 
for these online grocery merchants accelerates.

Grocery merchants confessed that there are top three fraud risks: online payment fraud (73%), 
account takeover or ATO (65%), and friendly fraud (58%).

To address these challenges, grocery merchants are spending an increasing amount of time 
manually reviewing transactions.

In order to combat fraud effectively, the grocery sector needs to consider introducing a 
combination of machine learning and customer behaviour analysis to provide a robust layer of 
defence.


#### So our task is to develop system which can identify pattern and that pattern will detect the fraud.

#### Our job is to detect the fraud, to build the model, to replicate the customer and to decide the scope.

# Objective
